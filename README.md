# Descriptive Analysis of Airline Prices - First Portfolio Project ✈️
In this project I’m taking on the role of a data analyst working for a travel agency to analyze airline prices. 
## Main goal 🎯
The goal is to understand how airline ticket prices vary based on different factors so that clients can always get the best possible deal and also understand what drives those prices up or down. This project focuses on exploring a simulated dataset I found on Codecademy's website, understanding each feature, and uncovering trends using **data visualization tools** in **Python**.
### The dataset🗒️
The dataset contains several flight-related features, including:
- ***miles*** – the distance traveled on the flight
+ ***passengers*** – number of passengers on board
* ***delay*** – take-off delay in minutes
- ***inflight_meal*** – whether a meal was included
+ ***inflight_entertainment*** – whether entertainment was available at each seat
- ***inflight_wifi*** – whether complimentary Wi-Fi was provided
+ ***day_of_week***– the day of the week of the flight
- ***weekend*** – whether the flight took place on a weekend
+ ***coach_price*** – the average ticket price for coach class
- ***firstclass_price*** – the average ticket price for first class
+ ***hours*** – the total flight duration in hours
- ***redeye*** – whether the flight was an overnight flight
