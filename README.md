# Exploratory Data Analysis of Airline Ticket Prices using Python ✈️
In this project I’m taking on the role of a data analyst working for a travel agency to explore and analyse airline prices.  
Python code and .csv dataset are available in the "master" branch here on GitHub.
## Main goal 🎯
The goal is to understand how airline ticket prices vary based on different factors so that clients can always get the best possible deal and also understand what drives those prices up or down. This project focuses on exploring a simulated dataset I found on Codecademy's website, understanding each feature, and uncovering trends using **data visualization tools** in **Python**.

### Python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Types of visualizations used:
- Combined boxplots
- Histograms
- Scatterplots

### The dataset🗒️
The dataset consists of 129,780 records containing various flight-related characteristics, including:
- ***miles*** – the distance traveled on the flight
+ ***passengers*** – number of passengers on board
* ***delay*** – take-off delay in minutes
- ***inflight_meal*** – whether a meal was included
+ ***inflight_entertainment*** – whether entertainment was available at each seat
- ***inflight_wifi*** – whether complimentary Wi-Fi was provided
+ ***day_of_week***– the day of the week of the flight
- ***weekend*** – whether the flight took place on a weekend
+ ***coach_price*** – the average ticket price for coach class
- ***firstclass_price*** – the average ticket price for first class
+ ***hours*** – the total flight duration in hours
- ***redeye*** – whether the flight was an overnight flight


## Executive Summary 🔍
This airline provides two fare classes: **Coach tickets**, averaging around 375€, and **First Class tickets**, averaging around 1450€. These type of tickets have a strong positive correlation, meaning higher coach prices come with higher first class prices. Ticket prices fluctuate based on flight duration and distance. Flights are more expensive on weekends, especially in First Class. Flight delays at this airline are typically minimal, however, notable exceptions do occur. Premium in-flight amenities, such as entertainment and Wi-Fi, are factors that drive prices higher. From a cost-saving perspective, it is recommended to travel on overnight flights and during weekdays.
