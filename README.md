# Airline Price Analysis Project ✈️
In this project, I’m taking on the role of a data analyst working for a travel agency. 
## Main goal 🎯
The goal is to understand how airline ticket prices vary based on different factors so that clients can always get the best possible deal and also understand what drives those prices up or down. This project focuses on exploring a simulated dataset I found on Codecademy, understanding each feature, and uncovering trends.
