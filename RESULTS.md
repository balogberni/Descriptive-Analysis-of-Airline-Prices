# Explanation of Results
This document deals with the presentation of results and their thorough explanation. 
Note, that in some cases a random sample was taken from the data to make the visualizations more transparent and readable, since the dataset contains 129 780 rows.

## Ticket price types

Prices above $500 are on the higher end, especially for shorter flights. Longer flights (8 hours) have higher average coach prices, making $500 more reasonable for these routes. Flight delays are usually short, with most under 20 minutes, but rare long delays do occur. First-class and coach prices are positively related; higher coach prices generally mean higher first-class prices. Inflight features (meals, entertainment, wifi) are associated with higher coach prices, with wifi showing the largest price increase. Number of passengers does not increase steadily with flight length; there are fewer flights with very high passenger counts. Weekend flights are more expensive, especially in first class. Redeye flights tend to have similar price differences from regular flights across all days, but weekend flights are pricier overall. Longer flights are more likely to offer meals and be redeyes, and there is a strong relationship between flight hours and miles. These findings can help clients understand what factors influence ticket prices and make informed travel decisions.
